# Wedding Gift contract

This is a simple 2-of-2 multisig which release any funds under two conditions:
1. Both owners will promises something to each other which will be stored in the Ethereum blockchain for eternity.
2. Both owners will have to agree on a signle address where the funds/gift will be send to.

Required setup:
* Get addresses of the bride & groom (if they don't have them you can print new paper wallets under assumption that you don't plan to robb your friends later)
* Set the public addresses as constants before publishing (Ye, they could have been set in constructor, but they wouldn't be constants)
* Send a simple transaction with ether as the gift (can be multiple transactions from different parties)

Have fun!
